# twittabout
Twitter following automation

Twittabout is a blend word. It's the fusion of "twitter" and "walkabout", the term conined by Crocodile Dundee. See http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=walkabout.

It's a known fact that if you follow people on Twitter, they're likely to follow you back. I originally wrote this very crude utility more than five years ago. I was very effective except, of course, it was just following orders and not thinking twice about following anyone. I haven't used it in a very long time, so it's now time to finally equip it with some intelli-gear. :-)
